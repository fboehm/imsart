# imsart
rmarkdown template for IMS journal articles

## Todo

- [x] create a new YAML field to accommodate Arxiv imprinting
  - [x] this will require a slight modification to template.tex, I think
- [ ] formatting for bibliography needed!
- [ ] make yaml fields to match required & suggested fields in ims-template.tex
